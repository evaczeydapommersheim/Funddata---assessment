## Introduction<p>

This repository was created for the assessment of "Fundamentals of Data Analysis" module in Winter Semester 2022 at Atlantic Techonological University (ATU) under HDip in Computing in Data Analytics, led by Dr. Ian McCloughlin.

This repository contains the following content:
1. **Normal Distribution Project folder**<p>
This folder includes a Project Jupyter Notebook explaining the main concepts of the Normal Distribution using python numpy package, python code and plots for visualization.<p>
***Table of Content:***
> 1. Introduction<p>
> 2. Definition and Properties of the Normal (Gaussian) Distribution<p>
> 2.1 Vizualization of the properties of the Normal Distribution<p>
> 2.1.1 Mean ($\mu$) and Median<p>
> 2.1.2 Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)<p>
> 2.1.3 Probability Density Function (PDF)<p>
> 3. The Standard Normal Distribution<p>
> 4. Empirical Rule
> 5. Central Limit Theorem
> 6. Importance and application of the Normal Distribution
> 7. Conclusion
2. **Practicals folder**<p>
This folder includes one csv file (morley.csv) and 05 Jupyter Notebooks, one for each topic discussed during this module:
> * Information
> * Randomness
> * Bias
> * Outliers
> * Cleansing<p>
Each notebook includes notes from the lectures and solutions to the exercises.<p>
At the beginning of each jupyter notebook there is a cell with references and links to the exercises which were given for each topic. The links allow to jump to each solution and bypass the notes, practices that were saved in the notebooks.<p>
The morley.csv file is kept in this folder as it is needed for Exercise 1 of Topic 04 - Outliers.<p>
3. **README file**

## Environment - System Requirement<p>

The majority of the content in this repository is presented in Jupyter Notebooks which can be accessed via alternative solutions depending on the level of activity desired while reviewing the notebooks.  

**Option A - Installation of the necessary environment**<p>

In order to run and/or modify the notebook on a local machine, the latest version of Python is recommended/required.  
An easy way to obtained/install python may be achieved by downloading the Anaconda open source package.  
> **Anaconda** is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.  
The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
Itâ€™s also is free to install and offers free community support.  

Following the installation of Python the Jupyter Notebook may be downloaded to the local machine from this repository.  
> **Step 1**<p>
Open your preferred command line on your local machine (CMDer for Windows and other built-in terminals for Linux and Mac OS)<p>
> **Step 2**<p>
>Navigate to the folder where the jupyter notebook(s) was(were) downloaded.<p>
> **Step 3** <p>
> Type command *jupyter notebook* and press enter which should open a new screen with the jupyter notebook content.<p>

**Option B - Viewing the notebook in the cloud**<p>

> **nbviewer** is a web application that lets a URL to be entered of a Jupyter Notebook file, it renders that notebook as a static HTML web page, and gives you stable link to that page which then can be shared with others. <p> nbviewer is an open source project under the larger Project Jupyter initiative along with other projects like Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, and JupyterHub.<p> Here is the static link to the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository:<p>
