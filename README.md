## Introduction<p>
---

This repository was created for the assessment project on Normal Distribution at ATU Winter Semester 2022 for Dr. Ian McCloughlin's module on Fundamentals of Data Analysis.  

## Environment - System Requirement<p>
---
This project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook which is part of this repository.  

There are multiple solution for running the jupyter notebook.

*Option A - Installation of the necessary environment*<p>

In order to run and/or modify the notebook on a local machine, the latest version of Python is required.  
An easy way to obtained/install python may be achieved by downloading the Anaconda open source package.  
> **Anaconda** is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.  
The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
Itâ€™s also is free to install and offers free community support.  

Following the installation of Python the Jupyter Notebook may be downloaded to the local machine from this repository.  
> **Step 1**<p>
Open your preferred command line on your local machine (CMDer for Windows and other built-in terminals for Linux and Mac OS)<p>
> **Step 2**<p>
>Navigate to the folder where the jupyter notebook was downloaded as Normal_Distribution_Project_Winter 2022-23.ipynb<p>
> **Step 3** <p>
> Type command jupyter notebook and press enter which should open a new screen with the jupyter notebook content.<p>

*Option B - Viewing the notebook in the cloud*

<p>

> **nbviewer** is a web application that lets a URL to be entered of a Jupyter Notebook file, it renders that notebook as a static HTML web page, and gives you stable link to that page which then can be shared with others. <p> nbviewer is an open source project under the larger Project Jupyter initiative along with other projects like Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, and JupyterHub.<p> Here is the static link to my Jupyter Notebook:<p> https://nbviewer.org/github/evaczeydapommersheim/Funddata---assessment/blob/main/Normal%20Distribution/Normal_Distribution_Project_Winter%202022-23.ipynb

> **Binder** is a service provided by the Binder Project, which is a member of the Project Jupyter open source ecosystem. It allows sharing a public Github Repository jupyter notebook file in a static manner. The code can be run, but no changes will be posted to the file. No collaboration is possible with this viewing option.<p>
