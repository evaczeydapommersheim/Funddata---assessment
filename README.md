This project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook which is part of this repository.  

In order to run and/or modify the notebook on a local machine, the latest version of Python is required.  
An easy way to obtained/install python may be achieved by downloading the Anaconda open source package.  
> Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.  
The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
Itâ€™s also is free to install and offers free community support.  

Following the installation of Python the Jupyter Notebook may be downloaded to the local machine from this repository.  
> **Step 1**<p>
Open your preferred command line on your local machine (CMDer for Windows and other built-in terminals for Linux and Mac OS)<p>
> **Step 2**<p>
>Navigate to the folder where the jupyter notebook was downloaded as Normal_Distribution_Project_Winter 2022-23.ipynb<p>
> **Step 3** <p>
> Type command jupyter notebook and press enter which should open a new screen with the jupyter notebook content.<p>
